# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

--------

### STILL TO DO:

- add error message for when movie already exists (currently validationerror `title is already taken`)
- write proper README
- finish building movie factory
- Tidy up units, inherit from a base? (dependency inject over inheritance? i.e. a module we `include` as opposed to inherit)
- DRY code
